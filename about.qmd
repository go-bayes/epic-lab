## Our Vision

The EPIC-lab (Evaluating Policy Implications with Causal-inference) is committed to advancing the science of causal inference to address pressing societal challenges. We believe that rigorous causal analysis is essential for evidence-based policy making and effective interventions.

## Our Mission

We bridge the gap between advanced quantitative methodology, psychological theory, and real-world application in New Zealand and globally.

- **Innovate:** advance causal inference methodology to address the unique challenges of psychological and behavioral research.
- **Impact:** partner with agencies and NGOs to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of social and behavioral interventions.
- **Empower:** develop and disseminate accessible statistical tools tailored for applied researchers and practitioners.
- **Train:** mentor the next generation of psychological scientists in methods for causal inference and machine-learning.


## Our Approach

We combine cutting-edge statistical methods with domain expertise to:

1. Identify and state clearly defined causal questions (harder than it seems!)
2. Design studies that can answer these questions
3. Apply robust analytical techniques
4. Communicate findings clearly
