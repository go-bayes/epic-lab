## Our Vision

The EPIC-lab (Evaluating Policy Implications with Causal-inference) is committed to advancing the science of causal inference to address long-standing debates and pressing real-world challenges. We believe that rigorous causal analysis is essential for evidence-based policy making and effective interventions.


## Our Approach

We combine cutting-edge statistical methods with domain expertise to:

1. Identify and state clearly defined causal questions (harder than it seems)
2. Design principled studies based on clear workflows that can answer these questions (also tricky)
3. Communicate technical findings clearly.
