## Our Vision

The EPIC-lab (Evaluating Policy Implications with Causal-inference) is committed to advancing the science of causal inference to address long-standing debates and pressing real-world challenges. We believe that rigorous causal analysis is essential for evidence-based policy making and effective interventions.


## Our Approach

We combine causal inference workflows with domain expertise to:

1. Identify and state clearly defined causal questions
2. Design studies that answer these questions
3. Clearly communicate findings
