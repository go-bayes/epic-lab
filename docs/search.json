    "text": "Disentangling the forces that shape human behaviour is like trying to isolate a single voice in a choir; simple observation reveals the music, but not who is singing which part. EPIC-Lab (Evaluating Policy Implications with Causal-inference) isolates that single voice. We pair the rigorous logic of causal inference with the predictive power of machine learning to quantify whether interventions work, for whom they are most effective, and under which circumstances they provide benefit. Our work delivers robust answers to urgent questions in psychological science and public policy. EPIC-Lab is based at the School of Psychological Science at Victoria University of Wellington-Te Herenga Waka, New Zealand."

Heterogeneous Causal Effects on Well-being and Cooperation in New Zealand\nPresenter: Joseph Bulbulia\nEvent: William Bier Interdisciplinary Award, APA Division 36 Psychology of Religion\nDate: 2025\nTime: 11:30-12:30\nLocation: Convention Centre Street Level 208\n\n\nConference Presentation | Duration: ~50 minutes | Format: HTML Slides\n\n\n\n    \n    This presentation is hosted on Dropbox for optimal performance.\n    \n        Open Presentation\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAlternative Viewing Options\n\n\n\n\nDownload: Use the download button in Dropbox to save a local copy.

We explore how the causal effects of religious participation on well-being and cooperation vary across different population subgroups, providing insights into when and for whom religious engagement promotes positive outcomes. The study links two literatures on religious attendance that have developed independently: health and cooperation.\nKeywords: causal inference, heterogeneous effects, religion, well-being, cooperation, longitudinal, panel, New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::"
