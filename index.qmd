## Welcome to the EPIC-lab

Disentangling the forces that shape human behaviour is like trying to isolate a single voice in a choir; simple observation reveals the music, but not who is singing which part. EPIC-Lab (**E**valuating **P**olicy **I**mplications with **C**ausal-inference) isolates that single voice. We pair the rigorous logic of causal inference with the predictive power of machine learning to quantify *whether* interventions work, *for whom* they are most effective, and *under which* circumstances they provide benefit. Our work delivers robust answers to urgent questions in psychological science and public policy. EPIC-Lab is based at the School of Psychological Science at Victoria University of Wellington-Te Herenga Waka, New Zealand.

## Our Mission


1. **Advance causal inference in the social sciences**, both in observational research and experimental design. 
<!-- - **Bridge theory and practice** by developing accessible tools for social scientists -->
2. **Educate scholars** through handsâ€‘on training in modern causal methods  
3. **Promote evidence-based decision making** through robust causal workflows and collaboration with experts.
