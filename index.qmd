## Welcome to the EPIC-lab

Understanding the forces that shape human behaviour is a formidable challenge. When governments roll out new initiatives —  to strengthen mental health, reduce prejudice, or promote sustainable choices — how can we be sure they achieve their aims?

EPIC‑Lab specialises in separating correlation from causation. We pair rigorous workflows for causal inference with machine learning to deliver robust, data‑driven answers to urgent questions in psychological science and public policy. We quantify *whether* interventions work, *for whom* they are most effective, and *under which circumstances* they provide benefit.

The EPIC-lab is based at the School of Psychological Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington—Te Herenga Waka.

## Our Mission

We'd like to:

- **Advance causal inference methodology in the social sciences**, both in observational research and experimental design. 
<!-- - **Bridge theory and practice** by developing accessible tools for social scientists -->
- **Educate and mentor emerging scholars** through hands‑on training in modern causal methods  
- **Foster collaboration** between researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners
- **Promote evidence-based decision making** through robust causal analysis
