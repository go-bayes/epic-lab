## Welcome to the EPIC-lab

Understanding the forces that shape human behaviour is formidable. How can we know what works? 

EPIC‑Lab specialises in separating correlation from causation. We pair rigorous workflows for causal inference with machine learning to deliver robust, data‑driven answers to urgent questions in psychological science and public policy. We quantify *whether* interventions work, *for whom* they are most effective, and *under which circumstances* they provide benefit.

EPIC-lab is based at the School of Psychological Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington—Te Herenga Waka.

## Our Mission

We'd like to:

- **Advance causal inference methodology in the social sciences**, both in observational research and experimental design. 
<!-- - **Bridge theory and practice** by developing accessible tools for social scientists -->
- **Educate and mentor emerging scholars** through hands‑on training in modern causal methods  
- **Promote evidence-based decision making** through robust causal analysis and collaboration between researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners
