**About** 

Professor Joseph Bulbulia (Joe) teaches and researches in the School of Psychological Science at Victoria University of Wellington. His research investigates the complex drivers of human cooperation, conflict, and well-being, with a focus on the role of religion and values. Answering such fundamental questions requires moving beyond correlation to identify cause and effect. To meet this challenge, Joseph specialises in methodologies for inferring causality from observational data and founded EPIC-Lab to advance this work. He also directs the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research (CACR).

**Research Projects**
Joe's methodological focus is applied through his leadership roles in two major longitudinal projects:

1. **New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)**: Joe is a member of the senior leadership team and principle investigator on the study's largest projects. He uses 15-years of repeated measures longitudinal data from over 76,000+ New Zealanders to investigate religion, social cohesion, and trust.

2. **Pulotu Database of Pacific Religions**: as a founding co-investigator, Joe uses this database of 116 Austronesian cultures to test theories about the evolution of religious beliefs and their effects on social behaviour.

#### Supervision

Joe supervises students in a broad range of areas, including:

-   Personality and individual differences
-   Political psychology
-   Well-being/Flourishing
-   Religion (his primary interest)
