**Abstract:** This presentation examines who benefits from religious attendance using heterogeneous treatment effect methods applied to longitudinal data from New Zealand. We explore how the causal effects of religious participation on well-being and cooperation vary across different population subgroups, providing insights into when and for whom religious engagement promotes positive outcomes.

**Keywords:** causal inference, heterogeneous effects, religion, well-being, cooperation, New Zealand
